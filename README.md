## What is an enclave?

[Intel SGX](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/software-guard-extensions/overview.html) delivers advanced hardware and RAM security encryption features, so called enclaves, in order to isolate code and data that are specific to each application. When data and application code run in an enclave additional security, privacy and trust guarantees are given, making the container an ideal choice for (untrusted) cloud environments.
